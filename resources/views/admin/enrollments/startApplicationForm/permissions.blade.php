After logging into their portal, students have access to a personalised email account and online applications. These resources enable students to collaborate with peers, publish online, and securely store their data for access within, or outside of, school. When accessing some online services, data, including the student’s name and files they have saved, are stored with the online application service provider in a location outside of the Department’s network. The Department has worked closely with online application providers to assess privacy impacts and data security controls. Information about student privacy for parents is available from <a href="https://education.nsw.gov.au/public-schools/going-to-a-public-school/privacy-information"><strong>https://education.nsw.gov.au/public-schools/going-to-a-public-school/privacy-information</strong></a> or from your school.</p>
